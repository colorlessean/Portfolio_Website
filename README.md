# Portfolio_Website
Django built website for personal portfolio matters, with a focus on expand ability.

Model layout will include several attributes of a portfolio:
    Homepage with a preview view of each of the side pagaes
    Work Experiences
    Projects
    Basic Bio with Skills Summary
    Eductation
    Awards and Certifications
    Volunteer Experience

Website layout will include a main page for the user to interact with a compact resume like format of the portfolio with a peek at each of the overall models.

The models will each be fully presented in a seperate view with each entry having its own page to be presented on with a default view being developed for each of them.

Certain models will not have their own page such as the Bio which will be remain as a mainpage or even a header, this is currently undecided.
